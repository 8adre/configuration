This course addresses the knowledge, skills and behaviors required to successfully manage projects that span organizations, national boundaries and cultural differences.</p>\n<p>In this course we will explore the impact on project management of culture, language variations, religious, regulatory and legal practices, technology penetration, temporal orientation, gender issues, corruption, ethics, personal liberty and political contexts. We learn how to meet global projects challenges through efficient use of practices and technology. The course will utilize available case studies and examples from companies to help students sharpen the skills needed to recognize and foster a successful international project environment.</p>\n<p>First, you will learn how culture affects how teams perceive each other, lead, solve problems and execute tasks. Although the world is increasingly connected, the people behind the projects have biases, expectations and a perception of life that impacts all decisions.</p>\n<p>Second, you will learn how to effectively manage global teams including how to build trust and collaboration across various cultures, time zones and technological settings. You will learn how to design communication channels and project structures effectively in a global project environment.</p>\n<p>Third, you will become familiar with the issues underlying the problem of corruption, which is the abuse of trusted power for private gain. Reducing the risk of corruption strengthens a companyâ€™s reputation, builds the respect of employees and raises credibility with key stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Finally, you will learn how the adoption of collaboration tools can enhance the global project experience.</p>\n<p>This course is part of the RIT Project Management MicroMasters Program that is designed to teach how to successfully deliver projects in an international environment.
